## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

---

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create the `.env` file**  
   Copy the contents of `.env-example` into a new `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env-example .env
   ```

2. **Fill in Environment Variables**  
   Edit the `.env` file to provide the required values for the database and other application configurations.

---

## Running the Application

1. **Build and Start the Containers**  
   Run the following commands to build the Docker image and bring up the containers:
   ```bash
   bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Stop the Containers**  
   To stop all running containers and services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

---

## Creating the Superuser

After the application is running, create a Django superuser to access the admin panel:

1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it condo_me_web_container python3 /app/src/manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the email, username, and password for the superuser.

---

## Getting Started with the App

The first steps to start using the app are:

1. On the homepage's top menu, select **"Pricing"**.
2. Click on **"Sign up now"** or **"Get started"**.
3. Fill in the following fields: **First Name**, **Last Name**, **E-mail**, and **Confirm your e-mail**.  
   *(Note: Since the app is still in development, it is not necessary to provide payment details.)*
4. Click on **"Continue to checkout"**.
5. In your terminal, a message identical to what would be sent to a paying user's e-mail will appear, containing login instructions. Copy the login link and paste it into your browser.
6. Fill in the **registration form** to gain access to the program.
7. Complete the **login form**.

By following the steps above, you will obtain access to the system as a user belonging to the **"manager"** group. Keep in mind that there are two additional user groups available: **"caretaker"** and **"resident"**. Each of these three groups has specific permissions and privileges. You can find more details about these groups through the **Django Admin Panel**.
