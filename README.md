**CondoMe** is an application that facilitates the organized and respectful use of shared spaces in condominiums.  
Administrators can set specific rules, enabling residents to book, reschedule, and cancel timeslots, ensuring transparency and fostering collective well-being.

## Features

- ðŸ“… **Shared Space Scheduling**: Total control for residents and administrators over time slots.
- ðŸ”„ **Customizable Rules**: Flexible rules to adapt to different condominium requirements.
- ðŸ“Š **Reports and Logs**: Keep track of bookings for transparency.
- ðŸŒŽ **Production-Ready**: Fully configured with Docker for portability and rapid deployment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Development Environment

This project is still in development. To streamline the development process, I recommend using the **Dev Containers** extension in **VS Code**. This allows you to develop directly within the container, keeping the environment consistent.

1. **VS Code Dev Containers**  
   The configuration file for this extension is available in the `.devcontainer` folder. Once you open the project in VS Code, use the shortcut `Shift+Ctrl+P` and select **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"** to start developing inside the container.

2. **Git Usage**  
   It is recommended to use **Git** on the host machine instead of within the container. This ensures a more seamless version control experience.

3. **VS Code Extensions**  
   Since the project is under development, several important extensions are used both in the container and the host environment to improve the development experience. These include:
   - **Better Jinja**
   - **Black Formatter**
   - **Dev Containers**
   - **Django**
   - **isort**
   - **Mypy Type Checker**
   - **Pylance**
   - **Python**
   - **Ruff**  
   
   More details about the extensions and their configuration can be found in the `pyproject.toml` file.


## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create the `.env` file**  
   Copy the contents of `.env-example` into a new `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env-example .env
   ```

2. **Fill in Environment Variables**  
   Edit the `.env` file to provide the required values for the database and other application configurations.

---

## Running the Application

1. **Build and Start the Containers**  
   Run the following commands to build the Docker image and bring up the containers:
   ```bash
   bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. **Stop the Containers**  
   To stop all running containers and services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

---

## Creating the Superuser

After the application is running, create a Django superuser to access the admin panel:

1. Run the following command inside Dev Container terminal:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the email, username, and password for the superuser.

---

## Getting Started with the App

The first steps to start using the app are:

1. On the homepage's top menu, select **"Pricing"**.
2. Click on **"Sign up now"** or **"Get started"**.
3. Fill in the following fields: **First Name**, **Last Name**, **E-mail**, and **Confirm your e-mail**.  
   *(Note: Since the app is still in development, it is not necessary to provide payment details.)*
4. Click on **"Continue to checkout"**.
5. In your terminal, a message identical to what would be sent to a paying user's e-mail will appear, containing login instructions. Copy the login link and paste it into your browser.
6. Fill in the **registration form** to gain access to the program.
7. Complete the **login form**.

By following the steps above, you will obtain access to the system as a user belonging to the **"manager"** group. Keep in mind that there are two additional user groups available: **"caretaker"** and **"resident"**. Each of these three groups has specific permissions and privileges. You can find more details about these groups through the **Django Admin Panel**.
